# Model-Agnostic Design

This project does not depend on any specific AI model or vendor.

Any image-conditioned system that can:
- accept a reference image
- operate in img2img mode
- respect structural constraints

may be used.

Consistency is enforced by:
- prompts
- configuration
- post-processing
